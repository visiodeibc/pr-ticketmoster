    "description": "Hi,\n\nWhile working on using https://amplitude.com/docs/data/source-catalog/snowflake we realized we need to backfill events published in the past. The current process involves nuking all the old events and republish again. However this results in counting the same events multiple times and drastically increases our events quota usage.\n\n\n\nWhat is the simplest procedure to update past published events? This will be needed during development process + bug fixing on data in snowflake while reviewing in production.",

I also renamed it so that the name is clear that is the one to be deleted (\"GameHouse - DELETEME\")\n\nThe other organization (the one in the US) should NOT be deleted. Only the one with the details and organization ID provided in this email.\n\nThe reason is simple. We created two organizations, but we are using only one.
