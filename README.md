# Zendesk Alert System

A streamlined AI-powered system that monitors Zendesk tickets for similar issues and sends intelligent Slack alerts. Features automatic pattern detection, custom query analysis, and comprehensive Amplitude product analytics expertise.

## What You Can Do With This Project

### üîç **Automatic Issue Detection**

‚Ä¢ **Detect recurring problems** - Automatically find when 5+ tickets report the same issue

- _Example: System detects 12 tickets about "chart loading failures" and alerts your team_

### ü§ñ **Ask Questions About Your Tickets**

‚Ä¢ **Get instant insights** - Ask natural language questions about your support data

- _Example: "How many billing issues happened this week?" ‚Üí "Found 8 billing tickets: 3 payment failures, 5 plan upgrades"_

### üìä **Product Analytics Intelligence**

‚Ä¢ **Amplitude expertise** - Specialized knowledge of product analytics, experimentation, and data integration issues

- _Example: Identifies "Experiment assignment issues" vs generic "API errors"_

### ‚ö° **Real-time Monitoring**

‚Ä¢ **Continuous oversight** - Monitor ticket patterns hourly or run on-demand checks

- _Example: Detects surge in SDK integration problems during a product release_

### üîî **Smart Slack Notifications**

‚Ä¢ **Rich alerts** - Get detailed notifications with clickable ticket links and context

- _Example: "üö® Alert: 7 Similar Support Tickets Detected - Chart Loading Failures in Analytics Dashboards"_

## Quick Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set environment variables:**

   ```bash
   # Zendesk API credentials
   export ZENDESK_URL="https://yourcompany.zendesk.com"
   export ZENDESK_EMAIL="your-email@company.com"
   export ZENDESK_TOKEN="your_api_token_here"

   # OpenAI API key (required for analysis)
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key_here"

   # Slack webhook URL (optional for notifications)
   export SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL"

   # Alert threshold (default: 5)
   export TICKET_CNT_THRESHOLD="5"
   ```

## Usage

### üîç **Pattern Detection (Automatic Issue Discovery)**

**Run Once (Single Check):**

```bash
python app.py                    # Default: single check
python app.py --once            # Explicit single check
```

_‚Üí Analyzes last 24 hours of tickets, groups similar issues, sends Slack alert if 5+ tickets match_

**Continuous Monitoring:**

```bash
python app.py --monitor         # Hourly checks with scheduler
```

_‚Üí Runs continuously, checking every hour for emerging patterns_

### ü§ñ **Custom Query Analysis (Ask Anything)**

Ask natural language questions about your tickets:

```bash
# Volume and trends
python app.py --query "How many experiment related tickets did we get today?"
python app.py --query "What are the most common SDK issues this week?"

# Specific problems
python app.py --query "Which tickets mention billing problems?"
python app.py --query "How many chart loading failures happened?"

# Customer insights
python app.py --query "Which organizations reported the most API issues?"
python app.py --query "What integration problems are customers facing?"

# Time-based analysis
python app.py --query "What billing issues happened this week?"
python app.py --query "Show me dashboard problems from yesterday"
```

### üõ† **Testing & Debugging**

```bash
# Run all tests
python test.py

# Test specific components
python test.py env          # Environment variables
python test.py zendesk      # Zendesk API connection
python test.py analysis     # Ticket analysis with sample data
python test.py slack        # Slack notifications
python test.py fields       # List all available Zendesk fields

# Test with Slack notifications enabled
SEND_TEST_SLACK=true python test.py slack
```

## Key Features

### ü§ñ **AI-Powered Analysis with Amplitude Expertise**

‚Ä¢ **Specialized Knowledge** - Trained on Amplitude's product documentation and common customer pain points

- _Example: Distinguishes "funnel configuration issues" from general "chart problems"_

‚Ä¢ **Automatic Clustering** - Groups similar tickets using OpenAI GPT-4 with product analytics context

- _Example: Groups "user identification", "session tracking", and "anonymous users" into "User Management Issues"_

‚Ä¢ **Custom Queries** - Ask questions in natural language and get intelligent answers

- _Example: "SDK integration problems" ‚Üí Lists iOS, Android, Web SDK issues with root cause analysis_

### üìä **Rich Data Analysis**

‚Ä¢ **Custom Field Extraction** - Analyzes Zendesk custom fields for enhanced context:

- Internal Chart/Tool information
- Steps to reproduce
- Request types and classifications
- JIRA ticket references
- Assignee and organization data
- _Example: Links JIRA tickets to support tickets for engineering context_

‚Ä¢ **Unified JSON Format** - Consistent, reliable response structure for all analysis types

- _Example: Same format whether asking about "billing issues" or detecting "API problems"_

‚Ä¢ **Time Window Intelligence** - Automatically extracts time references from queries

- _Example: "last week's experiment issues" ‚Üí Analyzes last 7 days of experiment-related tickets_

### üîî **Smart Slack Notifications**

‚Ä¢ **Rich Formatting** - Professional alerts with clickable ticket links and context

- _Example: Shows ticket #123456 with JIRA link, assignee, and organization info_

‚Ä¢ **Intelligent Grouping** - Different formats for different result sizes

- _Example: 3 tickets ‚Üí Full details with links; 25 tickets ‚Üí Compact summary with counts_

‚Ä¢ **Contextual Summaries** - AI-generated summaries tailored to the query or pattern

- _Example: "Found 12 experiment assignment issues affecting 4 organizations, primarily related to feature flag configuration"_

## How It Works

### üîç **Pattern Detection Mode** (`--once` or `--monitor`)

1. **Fetches** recent tickets from Zendesk API (last 24 hours)
2. **Extracts** custom fields and metadata for enhanced analysis
3. **Analyzes** tickets using OpenAI with Amplitude product expertise
4. **Groups** similar issues using AI clustering (minimum 5 tickets per group)
5. **Alerts** via Slack when patterns are detected with rich formatting
6. **Fallback** to sample data if Zendesk API is unavailable

_Example Flow: 86 tickets ‚Üí AI finds 17 "chart loading failures" ‚Üí Slack alert with ticket links_

### ü§ñ **Custom Query Mode** (`--query`)

1. **Extracts** time window from your question (if specified)
2. **Fetches** relevant tickets based on time window or defaults to 24 hours
3. **Analyzes** tickets using OpenAI with Amplitude product knowledge
4. **Answers** your specific question with categorized results
5. **Sends** formatted insights to Slack with supporting data
6. **Supports** complex queries about trends, issues, and customer patterns

_Example Flow: "billing issues this week" ‚Üí Analyzes 7 days ‚Üí Finds 8 tickets ‚Üí Groups by problem type ‚Üí Slack summary_
